Summary: Deep Learning For Medicine

Deep learning (a particular branch of artificial intelligence) 
has been experiencing rapid growth in the last few years. 
In particular, deep learning researchers have been able to 
demonstrate remarkable results in diagnostic radiology. 
Researchers at google trained a deep learning (DL) system to 
perform several tasks related to [detection of diabetic retinopathy](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2588763) in retinal photos. Another DL state-of-the-art result in applied medicine was performed by researchers at Stanford University in 2107 to [classify skin cancers](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature21056). Both of these studies were able to achieve same or better results than a panel of specialists.

These spectacular results have ginned up the buzz about the 
possibility of AI replacing medical jobs. However, there are still major 
hurdles facing the adoption of AI in the day to day practice, including 
finding sufficient and quality data to carry out more research and a 
long and complicated process of clinical trials and passing government 
regulations. On one hand, these technologies will probably 
supplement/replace certain diagnostic tasks for doctors, particularly 
radiologists. But on the other hand, by precipitating or helping faster
 cancer or other diagnostics, DL could increase demands for further medical 
 treatment and the need for training more specialists.

The more interesting development for me is that these recent advancement 
in DL has made it possible for its deployment in developing worlds. 
Already Google has partnered with hospitals in India to clinically test 
its diabetic retinopathy technology. Enlitic, a leading medial DL company, 
has begun [cooperating with Paiyipai](https://www.enlitic.com/press-release-04042017.html), a Chinese medical big data company, 
to deploy deep learning for diagnostic imaging in health check centers 
across China. China has far more relax regulatory framework so it makes 
sense for leading Medical DL companies to deploy their technologies in 
China.

Currently, there are billions of people in the world without access to 
modern medical diagnostics. Developing countries have 10x-20x shortages 
of doctors and specialists. Nigeria, for example, would need approximately
12 times as many doctors by 2030 (700,000 additional doctors) to catch 
up the number of doctors per capita of 25 members of Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) according to [this report
by World Bank](http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_HealthSystem_LeapfroggingEmergingEconomies_ProjectPaper_2014.pdf). So, an DL deployment in these countries can save millions of lives.
