Summary: 

I am a freelance machine learning/software engineer and live in San Fransisco. Previously, I worked as a system engineer for wireless and tele-com companies. 

I launched this blog when I started leanring about deep learning through the excellent fast.ai MOOK courses. I will be writing about deep learning learning and also a variety of topics related to the social implications of AI.
