Summary: Why write a blog?

I've been self-studying machine learning and deep learning for a about year now. 
In this blog, I will write about what I learn or what I do. 
I beileve the best way to master something is to teach it to someone else. 
I will be mainly focus on these courses:

-the deep learning course of fast.ai (part 1 and 2);
-the machine learning course of fast.ai;
-Python for data analysis.

I will be using manily pytorch for deep learning, along with numpy and pandas. I will occasionally share my personal projects and kaggle competitons that I will enter to, and will write about interesting articles in deep learning that I come across.
