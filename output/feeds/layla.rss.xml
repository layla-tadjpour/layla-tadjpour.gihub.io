In this blog, I will write about what I learn or what I do. I beileve the best way to master something is to teach it to someone else. I will be mainly focus on these courses:
-the deep learning course of fast.ai (part 1 and 2);
-the machine learning course of fast.ai;
-Python for data analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will be using manily pytorch for deep learning, along with numpy and pandas. I will occasionally share my personal projects and kaggle competitons that I will enter to, and will write about interesting articles in deep learning that I come across.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Layla</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 01 May 2018 10:01:00 -0700</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:None,2018-05-01:/Why Write A Blog</guid><category>first</category><category>misc</category></item></channel></rss>
